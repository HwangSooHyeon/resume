In preparation for this new role, I have proactively studied TypeScript, Next.js, Recoil, and Relay, actively contributing to various feature developments. Below is a summary of projects I participated in. For further details, please click the project titles listed in the timeline.",

  "cvHectoFinancialSubtitle": "Joined as a backend developer, responsible for maintaining a virtual account-based municipal tax payment solution for approximately 9 months. This solution was adopted by around 70% of local governments nationwide. Due to the servers being installed within the local governments’ internal networks, I regularly traveled to various municipalities to perform security inspections, log management, database index rebuilding, and replacement of outdated servers. Additionally, during peak municipal tax payment periods, I provided technical support to ensure smooth payment processing. I also participated actively in launching a new project related to a cash receipt and disbursement management solution, overseeing server procurement, installation, and conducting training sessions.",

  "cvWoowaSubtitle": "To familiariz with Kotlin, participants implement four toy projects with specific requirements (number of method lines, number of method parameters, etc.). Additionally, participants write test code for the implemented methods to verify that they produce the desired results. Since the course is not intended to be a direct training, it only provides guidelines and there are no restrictions on how paticipants implement it as long as the final test code for each toy project passes, so I focused on practicing TDD using those guidelines as a reference.",
  "cvItAcademyTitle": "Java ORM-based Application Software Developer",
  "cvItAcademySubtitle": "After leaving graduate school, I took some time to consider my future career path. While reflecting, I recalled how much I enjoyed programming during my undergraduate studies. Upon discovering the field of web development (distinct from embedded systems, which I was previously familiar with), I conducted approximately two months of research before deciding to pursue backend development. I enrolled in an accelerated training course focused on Java and the Spring Framework, through which I gained a solid foundational knowledge of web application development. However, the course did not cover the deployment and final build processes. To bridge this gap, I independently studied and successfully built and deployed applications using technologies including Raspberry Pi, Ubuntu Server, Tomcat, and Jenkins. Additionally, I configured port-forwarding and DDNS to enable external domain-based access, effectively simulating a fully operational website accessible from outside networks.",
  "cvItAcademyContent1": "Skills Acquired through Coursework: Java, Spring Framework, SQL, JavaScript, JSP, jQuery",
