  "cvDirectionalTitle": "Directional",
  "cvDirectionalSubtitle": "I joined as a Flutter Developer and participated in four Flutter-based projects over approximately two years. This role provided extensive experience, ranging from initial development and internal testing to actively addressing feedback from iOS and Android app store reviews, including feature updates and continuous improvements. Currently, all Flutter projects have concluded, and I have been assigned temporarily to support frontend web development on “Moneytoring”, a project by our affiliate, Quantit, preparing for an official release. In preparation for this new role, I have proactively studied TypeScript, Next.js, Recoil, and Relay, actively contributing to various feature developments. Below is a summary of projects I participated in. For further details, please click the project titles listed in the timeline.",
  "cvDirectionalContent1": "Investar - Crypto Currency Information App",
  "cvDirectionalContent2": "SBL APP - Stock Lending and Borrowing Relay App",
  "cvDirectionalContent3": "Investar Back Office - Community Administration Tool",
  "cvDirectionalContent4": "Fire Ant - Stock Short Selling Information App",
  "cvDirectionalContent5": "Moneytoring - Investment Information Community",
  "cvInvestarTitle": "Investar",
  "cvInvestarSubtitle": "When I joined the company, the service was already in live operation. I contributed approximately 60% of the overall development tasks, including developing new features and providing ongoing maintenance.",
  "cvInvestarDailyCoinSubtitle": "Daily Coin Analysis Page",
  "cvInvestarDailyCoinContent": "Developed a page allowing users to check coin analysis data once per day. Upon accessing, a loading screen appears, and data is cached via providers. Depending on the data state, the page either requests new data or displays cached results.",
  "cvInvestarRisingScoreSubtitle": "30-Minute Opportunities Page",
  "cvInvestarRisingScoreContent": "Built a page that updates a list of coins with high growth potential every 30 minutes. The server provides a validity period for current data, displayed as a countdown timer decreasing each second. When the timer reaches zero, the page indicates that data has expired and continuously requests updated validity periods from the server. Once new validity is received, fresh data is fetched and cached via providers.",
  "cvInvestarCarouselSubtitle": "Home Screen Carousel Banner",
  "cvInvestarCarouselContent": "Developed a feature that initializes carousel-related page providers and caches their data during the home screen build phase. Banners are rendered conditionally, based on whether relevant cached data is available.",

  "cvHectoFinancialTitle": "Hecto Financial",
  "cvHectoFinancialSubtitle": "Joined as a backend developer, responsible for maintaining a virtual account-based municipal tax payment solution for approximately 9 months. This solution was adopted by around 70% of local governments nationwide. Due to the servers being installed within the local governments’ internal networks, I regularly traveled to various municipalities to perform security inspections, log management, database index rebuilding, and replacement of outdated servers. Additionally, during peak municipal tax payment periods, I provided technical support to ensure smooth payment processing. I also participated actively in launching a new project related to a cash receipt and disbursement management solution, overseeing server procurement, installation, and conducting training sessions.",

  "cvHectoFinancialContent5": "Organized about 10 years of history into an integrated operations guide document",
  "cvWoowaTitle": "Woowacourse pre-course(Kotlin)",
  "cvWoowaSubtitle": "To familiariz with Kotlin, participants implement four toy projects with specific requirements (number of method lines, number of method parameters, etc.). Additionally, participants write test code for the implemented methods to verify that they produce the desired results. Since the course is not intended to be a direct training, it only provides guidelines and there are no restrictions on how paticipants implement it as long as the final test code for each toy project passes, so I focused on practicing TDD using those guidelines as a reference.",
  "cvItAcademyTitle": "Java ORM-based Application Software Developer",
  "cvItAcademySubtitle": "After leaving graduate school, I took some time to consider my future career path. While reflecting, I recalled how much I enjoyed programming during my undergraduate studies. Upon discovering the field of web development (distinct from embedded systems, which I was previously familiar with), I conducted approximately two months of research before deciding to pursue backend development. I enrolled in an accelerated training course focused on Java and the Spring Framework, through which I gained a solid foundational knowledge of web application development. However, the course did not cover the deployment and final build processes. To bridge this gap, I independently studied and successfully built and deployed applications using technologies including Raspberry Pi, Ubuntu Server, Tomcat, and Jenkins. Additionally, I configured port-forwarding and DDNS to enable external domain-based access, effectively simulating a fully operational website accessible from outside networks.",
  "cvItAcademyContent1": "Skills Acquired through Coursework: Java, Spring Framework, SQL, JavaScript, JSP, jQuery",
  "cvItAcademyContent2": "Independently Learned Skills: Build & Deployment Processes, Version Control (Git), Data Structures, Algorithms",

  "cvMoneytoringTitle": "Moneytoring",
  "cvMoneytoringSubtitle": "Currently dispatched for approximately 4 months to support “Moneytoring,” a new project by our affiliate, Quantit. As this project is built on Next.js, I proactively studied technologies including TypeScript, Next.js, Recoil, and Relay, contributing actively to the development of various features and pages.",
  "cvMoneytoringContent1": "Developed an improved version of the onboarding screens displayed after user registration. Integrated new APIs replacing legacy endpoints and adjusted data structures accordingly.
