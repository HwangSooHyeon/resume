  "cvEducationBootCamp": "Woowacourse pre-course(Kotlin)",
  "cvEducationBootCamp1": "To familiariz with Kotlin, participants implement four toy projects with specific requirements (number of method lines, number of method parameters, etc.). Additionally, participants write test code for the implemented methods to verify that they produce the desired results. Since the course is not intended to be a direct training, it only provides guidelines and there are no restrictions on how paticipants implement it as long as the final test code for each toy project passes, so I focused on practicing TDD using those guidelines as a reference.",
